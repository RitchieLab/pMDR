1.  Introduction

    Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a non-parametric, model 
    free method for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
    The previous implementation of MDR was limited in its ability to 
    analyze large datasets.  Parallel multifactor dimensionality reduction 
    (pMDR) uses a new algorithm that can scale to handle extremely large 
    datasets.  pMDR is implemented using the Message Passing Interface
    (MPI) to allow for processing on multiple processors.


2.  Example

    To run the sample included, navigate into the example directory:

    mpirun -np 2 ../bin/pMDR xor.cfg
    
    or 
    
    mpiexec -np 2 ../bin/pMDR xor.cfg
    
    
    mpirun and mpiexec are executables included with the MPI implementation.
    The -np option specifies the number of processors used.

    To run across multiple machines, create a machinefile listing each
    machine on a line and then run with the -machinefile option.  See
    the MPI documentation for more information about mpirun or mpiexec.
    
    mpirun -np 4 -machinefile machinesfile ../bin/pMDR xor.cfg
    
    or 
    
    mpiexec -np 4 -machinefile machinesfile ../bin/pMDR xor.cfg
    
    
    
    Output:
    
    xor.mdr.out

    

3.  Input files

    a.  pMDR takes a single configuration file as a command-line argument.  
    This file should list all the parameters for controllling the analysis.
    It takes the format of keyword <whitespace> value.  Each keyword should
    be on its own line.  Comments can start with '//' as in C++.  Any
    parameter without a default value is required.
    
    
###########  configuration file parameters ###########

Parameter        Default   Description
---------        -------   -----------------    
FILENAME            none   Specifies the location and name of the
                           data input file.

MAPFILE             none   Allows names to be specified for the variables
                           in the data file.  The first column should be
                           the chromosome number, second column the name 
                           and third column the position of the SNP.  This
                           file is optional and the reports will use the
                           relative position of the SNPs in the report if
                           it isn't provided.  In addition, the base 
                           position (3rd column) is currently not used and
                           can be filled with any number.
                         
MAXLOCIVALUE        none   Maximum value for an input variable.  The
                           minimum is always 0.
                        
CALCTHRESHOLD       SET    Threshold for assigning high/low risk
                           for a genotype during evaluation of a 
                           model.  It is either calculated by the 
                           overall ratio in the dataset (SET) or it
                           can be calculated for each model (MODEL).
                           It is faster to calculate on the SET, but
                           may be necessary to calculate per model
                           if there are missing genotypes in the dataset.

COMBOSTART          none   Minimum number of loci making up
                           a combination to be tested.  A '2' means
                           2-loci models will be tested initially
                           and larger models will be tested exhaustively
                           until COMBOEND is reached.
                        
COMBOEND            none   Maximum number of loci making up
                           a combination to be tested. A '3' means
                           no models involving more than 3 loci
                           will be tested.

MODELBUILDINTERVAL  none   Specifies how many models will be evaluated
                           by each process before requesting more
                           models to evaluate.

CROSSVALINTERVAL    1      Number of cross-validation intervals to
                           perform.  Setting it to 1 means no 
                           cross-validation will be done.
                           
MODELSTOKEEP        1      Number of models that will be kept per
                           loci combination and per cross-validation.
                           Set to 'ALL' to keep every model. WARNING:
                           If testing many combinations this can
                           greatly slow the analysis and create
                           a very large output file.
 
ALWAYSINCLUDED     none    Specify a SNP that will always be included
                           in the models to be run.  Specify the SNP
                           by name if a map file was used or specify
                           by position number if not.

RANDOMSHUFFLE      none    Values are 'ON' or 'OFF'.  When 'ON', the
                           individuals are shuffled before splitting
                           them to do cross-validation.  
                           
RANDOMSEED         none    Seeds the random number generator for the
                           random shuffle of individuals.
                           
NOTRECOGNIZEDRESPONSE 1    Sets how a genotype is evaluated that is 
                           encountered during testing but not classified
                           during training.
                           Values are: -1 (Unknown), 0 (Unaffected),
                           1 (Affected)
                           
TIECELLVALUE          1    Sets a genotype risk when equal numbers of
                           affected and unaffected individuals during 
                           training.
                           Values are: -1 (Unknown), 0 (Unaffected),
                           1 (Affected)
                           
BESTPARTITION       OFF    Shows data partition for best model.
                           Values are: OFF, ON
                           The partitions are recorded
                           in a partitions file.

SHOWRULES           OFF    Displays rules for models.  Appears in the
                           rules file.
                           
SHOWTOTALS          OFF    Displays matrix of true positives, false positives,
                           etc. in the totals file.

                           
MISSING              -1    Sets value for missing data in dataset.

POWERMODEL          OFF    Specifies whether to determine and display
                           the best model across all combination
                           sizes.
                           Values are:  OFF, ON

PTEST-N               0    Specifies number of permutation tests to perform
                           to assign significance to the models.  This will
                           increase the running time as each permutation test
                           takes as long as the initial run of the data.
                           
CHECKINTERVAL         0    Set to a percentage that will record all data necessary
                           for restarting the run from that point.  For example,
                           setting this to 10 will result in a check point file
                           being written every 10% of the run.
                           
CHECKPOINTFILE     none    Specifies location of a checkpoint file.  The analysis
                           will continue from the point at which the checkpoint
                           file was generated.


                           				
                        
    b.  pMDR accepts data in a simple format.  Each line is a separate
    individual.  The first column is the phenotype of the individual and
    must be either 0 or 1.  Each additional column contains the value
    of a variable or locus in the case of genotypic data.  These values
    range from 0 to the MAXLOCIVALUE set in the configuration value or
    must equal the value for missing data.

    

4.  Algorithm

    MDR is implemented with a cross-validation framework (typically 
    10-fold).  In step 1 of the process, the data are divided into 
    a training set (9/10 of the data) and a testing set (1/10 of the data).  
    Next, a set of n genetic and/or environmental factors are selected 
    from the set of all possible factors, N.  Each individual in the 
    training set is grouped according to its state at each of the n factors 
    (i.e. for 2 loci with 3 possible genotypes, there are 9 possible 
    combinations; for 3 loci, 27 etc.)  Then, each genotype combination 
    is classified as high or low risk depending on the ratio of cases to 
    controls with that genotype combination.  If the ratio is less than the ratio
    of cases and controls in the dataset, the genotype combination is classified 
    as low risk.  If the ratio is equal to or greater than the ratio of cases 
    to controls in the dataset, the genotype combination is classified as high 
    risk.  This collection of high and low risk groups forms the MDR model 
    for that combination of factors, and the fitness of that model is determined 
    by balanced accuracy, [(sensitivity+specificity)/2] .  To evaluate the 
    predictive ability  of a model, a prediction error is calculated based 
    on the proportion of individuals in the testing set that are incorrectly 
    labeled by the model.  Each combination of variables (1 to k-variables) 
    specified by the user is evaluated in this fashion, and the entire 
    procedure is performed 10 times, using each 1/10th as a testing set and 
    each 9/10th as a training set.
    
    pMDR selects the best model for each order of loci (1-locus,
    2-locus, etc.) by calculating a cross-validation consistency (CVC).
    CVC is the total # of occurrences for a model across the cross-validation
    sets.  The model with the highest CVC is reported as the best model with
    that number of loci included.  If two or more models have identical
    CVC, then the model with the highest prediction accuracy among those is 
    selected.
    
    pMDR selects the single best model across all order of loci by selecting the
    model with the highest CVC and highest prediction accuracy.  If one model
    has the highest CVC and the other has the highest prediction accuracy, parsimony
    is used and the model with the fewest loci is selected.
